vagrant-devstack-swift
======================

Automate the creation of an openstack VM with devstack installed, running Swift &amp; Keystone


## Prereqs

Install [Vagrant 1.1+](http://vagrantup.com) on your local engine.
Open an account on your openstack cloud provider and create an tenant with a firewall openbar.

An alternative is to use virtualbox on your engine with at least 8GB of RAM availables. Never launch devstack on your desktop as it can corrupt your environnement.

 ## Boot the remote virtual machine and install DevStack

     git clone https://github.com/f2brossi/vagrant-devstack-swift
     cd vagrant-devstack-swift
     vagrant plugin install vagrant-openstack-provider
     vagrant up --provider=openstack

 The `vagrant up --provider=openstack` command will:

  1. Download an Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy) vagrant box if it hasn't previously been downloaded to your machine.
  2. Boot the virtual machine (VM) on your openstack cloud provider .
  3. Clone the DevStack git repository inside of the VM.
  4. Run manually DevStack inside of the VM with command >/home/stack/devstack/stack.sh

 It will take at least ten minutes for this to run.


## Provisioning

For now with puppet.
