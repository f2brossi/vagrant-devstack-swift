# Swift
# -----

# Swift is now used as the back-end for the S3-like object store. If Nova's
# objectstore (``n-obj`` in ``ENABLED_SERVICES``) is enabled, it will NOT
# run if Swift is enabled. Setting the hash value is required and you will
# be prompted for it if Swift is enabled so just set it to something already:
SWIFT_HASH=66a3d6b56c1f479c8b4e70ab5c2000f5

# For development purposes the default of 3 replicas is usually not required.
# Set this to 1 to save some resources:
SWIFT_REPLICAS=1

# The data for Swift is stored by default in (``$DEST/data/swift``),
# or (``$DATA_DIR/swift``) if ``DATA_DIR`` has been set, and can be
# moved by setting ``SWIFT_DATA_DIR``. The directory will be created
# if it does not exist.
SWIFT_DATA_DIR=$DEST/data
#SWIFT_DATA_DIR=/srv/1/node
